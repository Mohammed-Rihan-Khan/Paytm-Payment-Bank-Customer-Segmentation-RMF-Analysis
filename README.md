# Paytm Payment Bank Customer Segmentation: RMF Analysis
## Overview
This project implements customer segmentation for a banking institution using RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis and machine learning techniques. By analyzing transaction patterns, the model categorizes bank customers into distinct segments, enabling targeted marketing strategies and improved customer relationship management.

## Introduction
Customer segmentation is a vital strategy for banks to understand their diverse customer base and tailor services accordingly. This project utilizes RFM analysis, a powerful customer segmentation technique that evaluates customers based on three key dimensions:
- **Recency (R)**: How recently a customer has made a transaction
- **Frequency (F)**: How often a customer makes transactions
- **Monetary (M)**: How much money a customer spends on transactions

By scoring customers on these dimensions, banks can identify their most valuable customers, understand behavior patterns, and develop targeted marketing strategies.

## Dataset
The analysis uses the "bank_transactions.csv" dataset containing the following variables:
- **TransactionID**: Unique identifier for each transaction
- **CustomerID**: Unique identifier for each customer
- **CustomerDOB**: Customer's date of birth
- **CustGender**: Customer's gender
- **CustLocation**: Customer's location
- **CustAccountBalance**: Account balance at the time of transaction
- **TransactionDate**: Date of the transaction
- **TransactionTime**: Time of the transaction
- **TransactionAmount (INR)**: Transaction amount in Indian Rupees

## Methodology
The project follows these key steps:
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning, handling missing values, and transforming variables
2. **RFM Calculation**:
   - Recency: Days since last transaction
   - Frequency: Total number of transactions
   - Monetary: Total amount spent
3. **Feature Engineering**: Applying log transformation to handle skewness
4. **Clustering**: Using K-means algorithm with the optimal number of clusters
5. **Scoring**: Assigning RFM scores based on quartiles
6. **Segmentation**: Creating comprehensive customer segments based on RFM scores

## Key Features
- Comprehensive data cleaning and preprocessing
- Log transformation to handle skewed distributions
- Optimal cluster determination using the Elbow Method
- 3D visualization of customer segments
- Detailed RFM scoring system
- Strategic interpretation of customer clusters

## Technical Implementation
The project utilizes several advanced techniques:
- **Data Transformation**: Log transformation to normalize skewed distributions
- **Feature Scaling**: StandardScaler for normalizing feature ranges
- **Clustering Algorithm**: K-means with an optimized number of clusters
- **Visualization**: 2D and 3D scatter plots for cluster visualization
- **Quantile-based Scoring**: Dividing customers into quartiles for RFM scoring

## Results and Insights
The analysis identified four distinct customer segments:

### **Cluster 0: Low-Value, At-Risk Customers**
**Recency:** 58 days (moderate)

**Frequency:** ~1 transaction (very low)

**Monetary:** ‚Çπ67 (extremely low spending)

#### **Interpretation:**
Customers in this cluster are sporadic users who make very few transactions and spend the least amount. They are at risk of becoming inactive or completely disengaged from the banking services.

#### **Strategy:**
**üìå Reactivation Campaigns:** Provide special promotions, cashback, or rewards for transactions.

**üìå Personalized Outreach:** Offer reminders, alerts, or targeted financial products to keep them engaged.

**üìå Understanding Barriers:** Conduct surveys to analyze why these customers have low engagement.

### **Cluster 1: High-Engagement Customers**
**Recency:** 48 days (moderate)
**Frequency:** ~2 transactions (moderate)
**Monetary:** ‚Çπ1071 (high spending)
#### **Interpretation:**
This cluster consists of frequent users with high spending power, making them a valuable customer segment. These customers are actively using banking services and show strong potential for loyalty.

#### **Strategy:**
**üìå Exclusive Loyalty Programs:** Offer reward-based transactions, higher interest rates on savings, or exclusive investment opportunities.

**üìå Personalized Banking Services:** Provide dedicated relationship managers or financial advisors.

**üìå Cross-Selling Opportunities:** Introduce them to premium credit cards, loans, or wealth management services.

### **Cluster 2: Wealthy But Infrequent Users**
**Recency:** 66 days (moderate-high)
**Frequency:** ~1 transaction (very low)
**Monetary:** ‚Çπ719 (high spending)
#### **Interpretation:**
This segment consists of high-value customers who transact very infrequently. They may be using the bank for specific services but are not fully engaged.

#### **Strategy:**
**üìå Encourage More Frequent Transactions:** Offer benefits for repeated usage, such as transaction-based rewards.

**üìå Highlight Additional Services:** Introduce them to investment options, savings plans, or financial advisory.

**üìå Reduce Inactivity Risk:** Personalized follow-ups and special incentives for continued banking engagement.

### **Cluster 3: Young & Growing Customers**
**Recency:** 39 days (low, very recent transactions)
**Frequency:** ~1 transaction (low-moderate)
**Monetary:** ‚Çπ612 (moderate spending)
#### **Interpretation:**
This segment consists of recently active customers who are moderate spenders but have not yet reached high levels of engagement. They may include new customers or young professionals testing banking services.

#### **Strategy:
**üìå Onboarding Support:** Provide educational resources, app tutorials, and welcome offers.

**üìå Incentives for More Usage:** Cashback on first deposits, discounts on digital transactions, or promotional interest rates.

**üìå Personalized Customer Journey:** Offer targeted recommendations based on their banking behavior.

###**üìå Conclusion**
Applying K-Means clustering to Recency, Frequency, and Monetary (RFM) data has provided valuable insights into customer segmentation. The segmentation reveals four distinct customer types:

**1Ô∏è‚É£ At-Risk Customers** ‚Äì Require re-engagement to prevent churn.

**2Ô∏è‚É£ High-Engagement Customers** ‚Äì Need loyalty programs to maximize lifetime value.

**3Ô∏è‚É£ Wealthy But Infrequent Users** ‚Äì Need incentives for higher transaction frequency.

**4Ô∏è‚É£ Growing Customers** ‚Äì Require nurturing to develop long-term engagement.


Strategically implementing personalized banking offers, proactive customer service, and targeted marketing campaigns will help maximize customer retention, satisfaction, and long-term profitability in the banking sector.
